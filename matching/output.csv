This virtual residency, part of Kolaj Institute’s ongoing Collage & Illustration project, seeks to bring together a dynamic group of artists who are passionate about merging art, literature, and the human experience. The resulting illustrations will be published alongside Orlando: A Biography, allowing artists to bring a fresh, contemporary perspective to this timeless narrative. A curated selection of artwork will also be exhibited at Kolaj Fest New Orleans 2024. Orlando: A Biography narrates the extraordinary life of the titular character, who experiences centuries of existence, transitioning from male to female along the way. As Nancy Bernardo writes, “Orlando is a unique book that crosses the boundaries of gender roles and relationships, paralleling Woolf’s own complex feelings of heterosexual conformity, her role as a wife, and her affair with Vita Sackville-West.” Woolf’s exploration of gender, time, and self-discovery creates a world and a character that is truly “transhistorical, transsexual, translinear, and transient.” During this project-driven virtual residency spanning four weeks, artists will collaboratively produce a series of collages that capture the essence of Orlando’s journey. As a group, participants will engage in discussions, analyze narrative nuances, and explore visual representations that resonate with a 21st-century audience. The residency will conclude with a deadline scheduled a month after the residency ends for the finished illustrations, allowing artists ample time to immerse themselves in their creative process and develop their unique interpretations.

By banding together and pooling the resources of like-minded artists and art appreciators, CTF is making the changes they want to see in communities around the country. Residents who identify as BIPOC can receive unrestricted funding in addition to their monthly honorarium.

This virtual residency, part of Kolaj Institute’s ongoing Collage & Illustration project, seeks to bring together a dynamic group of artists who are passionate about merging art, literature, and the human experience. The resulting illustrations will be published alongside Orlando: A Biography, allowing artists to bring a fresh, contemporary perspective to this timeless narrative. A curated selection of artwork will also be exhibited at Kolaj Fest New Orleans 2024. Orlando: A Biography narrates the extraordinary life of the titular character, who experiences centuries of existence, transitioning from male to female along the way. As Nancy Bernardo writes, “Orlando is a unique book that crosses the boundaries of gender roles and relationships, paralleling Woolf’s own complex feelings of heterosexual conformity, her role as a wife, and her affair with Vita Sackville-West.” Woolf’s exploration of gender, time, and self-discovery creates a world and a character that is truly “transhistorical, transsexual, translinear, and transient.” During this project-driven virtual residency spanning four weeks, artists will collaboratively produce a series of collages that capture the essence of Orlando’s journey. As a group, participants will engage in discussions, analyze narrative nuances, and explore visual representations that resonate with a 21st-century audience. The residency will conclude with a deadline scheduled a month after the residency ends for the finished illustrations, allowing artists ample time to immerse themselves in their creative process and develop their unique interpretations.

Ever since the 18th century, the world of art has given us landscapes that attest to the urban changes imposed by the industrial and technological development of that time.
With this call LoosenArt wants to collect photographic, video and digital visual design works capable of offering visions of present-day landscapes dominated by human presence.
The works on display will address the theme through the many aspects that concern the relationship between man and environment, all this from a perspective that focuses on different levels of interest, such as anthropological, social, historical, cultural, political and environmental.

This is a speakeasy art party in the void. 
In the darkest corners of existence, where the void meets the infernal, there exists a unique and unsettling phenomenon—an infernal party that defies all earthly norms. “The void” is a theme that delves into the eerie and fascinating concept of a party that takes place in the very heart of the abyss, where chaos and celebration blend into a surreal and unsettling experience.   We are looking for artists with various backgrounds who want to showcase their works under the theme of the void. There is no limit on the techniques, materials, and mediums you use. Performance, sound, installations, videos, and all kinds of digital & non-digital arts are accepted!  "

This virtual residency, part of Kolaj Institute’s ongoing Collage & Illustration project, seeks to bring together a dynamic group of artists who are passionate about merging art, literature, and the human experience. The resulting illustrations will be published alongside Orlando: A Biography, allowing artists to bring a fresh, contemporary perspective to this timeless narrative. A curated selection of artwork will also be exhibited at Kolaj Fest New Orleans 2024. Orlando: A Biography narrates the extraordinary life of the titular character, who experiences centuries of existence, transitioning from male to female along the way. As Nancy Bernardo writes, “Orlando is a unique book that crosses the boundaries of gender roles and relationships, paralleling Woolf’s own complex feelings of heterosexual conformity, her role as a wife, and her affair with Vita Sackville-West.” Woolf’s exploration of gender, time, and self-discovery creates a world and a character that is truly “transhistorical, transsexual, translinear, and transient.” During this project-driven virtual residency spanning four weeks, artists will collaboratively produce a series of collages that capture the essence of Orlando’s journey. As a group, participants will engage in discussions, analyze narrative nuances, and explore visual representations that resonate with a 21st-century audience. The residency will conclude with a deadline scheduled a month after the residency ends for the finished illustrations, allowing artists ample time to immerse themselves in their creative process and develop their unique interpretations.

This regional show features artwork from an extensive variety of mediums and explores creative movements happening in California. The Solo Show opportunity offered during MICA is a chance for artists to have their own solo exhibition in the Gallery that would run concurrent to the greater Made in California Juried Exhibition, and would include a separate title wall, show card, and a $350 cash prize. To enter, an artist must submit a cohesive body of work of between 5 and 10 pieces, along with an artist statement for the jurors, for a flat rate of $80. Meaning an artist can submit up to 10 pieces for just $80, rather than for $20 each for individual juried entries (a $200 value). Additionally, if an artist’s body of work is not selected for the solo show, each piece will then be considered individually by the jurors for the greater juried exhibition and would be eligible for all of the other awards (First, Second, etc.), so the work will be considered twice for the flat rate of $80."
